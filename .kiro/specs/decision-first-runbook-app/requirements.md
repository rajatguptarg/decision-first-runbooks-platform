# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Decision First Runbook App is a production-ready reference implementation for managing and displaying decision-first incident runbooks. The application enables teams to author, store, and execute structured incident response procedures through an interactive viewer and editor interface. Unlike traditional procedural runbooks, this system emphasizes decision points that guide responders through critical thinking processes during incidents, ensuring appropriate escalation paths and reducing mean time to resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Runbook Management

**User Story:** As an editor, I want to create, read, update, and delete runbooks, so that I can maintain up-to-date incident response procedures for my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an editor creates a new runbook THEN the system SHALL store the runbook with title, owner, severity level, and decision tree structure
2. WHEN an editor updates an existing runbook THEN the system SHALL preserve version history and update timestamps
3. WHEN an editor deletes a runbook THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and remove all associated data
4. WHEN a user views a runbook THEN the system SHALL display all metadata including title, owner, severity, and last modified date

### Requirement 2: Interactive Decision Tree Viewer and Execution

**User Story:** As an incident responder, I want to navigate through and execute structured runbook procedures during incidents, so that I can make informed decisions and follow appropriate response paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a responder opens a runbook THEN the system SHALL display the initial decision point with available options
2. WHEN a responder selects a decision option THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding next step or action
3. WHEN a responder reaches an action node THEN the system SHALL display clear instructions and any required escalation information
4. WHEN a responder navigates through the decision tree THEN the system SHALL maintain a breadcrumb trail of their path
5. WHEN a responder executes a runbook step THEN the system SHALL mark the step as completed and record execution timestamp
6. WHEN a responder completes an action THEN the system SHALL automatically progress to the next decision point or completion state

### Requirement 3: Runbook Execution and Session Management

**User Story:** As an incident responder, I want to execute runbook steps and track my progress through decision graphs, so that I can systematically work through incident response procedures and maintain accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts executing a runbook THEN the system SHALL create a new incident session with timestamp and runbook ID
2. WHEN a user executes a runbook step THEN the system SHALL mark the step as completed, record execution timestamp, and log any outputs or notes
3. WHEN a user makes decisions in the decision graph THEN the system SHALL log the decision path with reasoning and timestamp
4. WHEN a session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a real-time timeline of all executed steps and decisions
5. WHEN a user pauses execution THEN the system SHALL save the current state and allow resumption from the same point
6. WHEN a session completes THEN the system SHALL store the complete execution history including all steps, decisions, and outcomes

### Requirement 4: Search and Discovery

**User Story:** As an incident responder, I want to search and filter runbooks by title, owner, or severity level, so that I can quickly find the appropriate procedures during time-sensitive incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the system SHALL return runbooks matching title, owner, or content
2. WHEN a user applies severity filters THEN the system SHALL display only runbooks matching the selected severity levels
3. WHEN a user applies owner filters THEN the system SHALL display only runbooks owned by the selected users
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight matching terms and show relevance ranking

### Requirement 5: Export and Print Capabilities

**User Story:** As an incident responder, I want to export runbooks and print procedures, so that I can access critical information during system outages or offline scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests runbook export THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing the complete runbook structure
2. WHEN a user requests path export THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing their current navigation path
3. WHEN a user requests print view THEN the system SHALL display a print-optimized layout without navigation elements
4. WHEN printing a runbook THEN the system SHALL include all decision paths and action items in a readable format

### Requirement 6: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user roles and permissions, so that I can control who can view versus edit runbooks based on their responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and assign appropriate role permissions
2. WHEN a viewer accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide read-only access to runbooks
3. WHEN an editor accesses the system THEN the system SHALL provide full CRUD operations on runbooks
4. WHEN a user attempts unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt

### Requirement 7: User Authentication and Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure user authentication with session management, so that I can ensure only authorized personnel access incident procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL create a secure JWT session with HTTP-only cookies
2. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing further access
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session and clear authentication cookies
4. WHEN storing user passwords THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt hashing for secure storage

### Requirement 8: Data Persistence and Performance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data storage with fast query performance, so that incident responders can access procedures quickly during critical situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN runbooks are stored THEN the system SHALL use MongoDB with appropriate indexes for fast retrieval
2. WHEN users search for runbooks THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms for typical queries
3. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds
4. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL ensure ACID compliance for critical operations

### Requirement 9: Containerized Execution Environment

**User Story:** As an editor, I want to define custom execution environments for runbooks, so that commands can run in isolated, reproducible containers with the necessary tools and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an editor creates a runbook THEN the system SHALL allow specification of a custom container environment with required tools and dependencies
2. WHEN a runbook execution is triggered THEN the system SHALL spawn a new container instance based on the runbook's defined environment
3. WHEN commands are executed within a runbook step THEN the system SHALL run them inside the isolated container environment
4. WHEN a runbook execution completes THEN the system SHALL clean up the container instance and capture any outputs or logs
5. WHEN multiple runbooks execute simultaneously THEN the system SHALL manage separate container instances for each execution session
6. WHEN a container environment fails to start THEN the system SHALL log the error and notify the user with appropriate fallback options

### Requirement 10: System Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want structured logging and metrics, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system events occur THEN the system SHALL log structured JSON messages with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL record request metrics for Prometheus monitoring
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and context
4. WHEN system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL emit alerts through the monitoring system
5. WHEN container executions occur THEN the system SHALL log container lifecycle events and resource usage
